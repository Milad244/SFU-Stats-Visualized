# TODO

## General
- [x] Let user select what graph they want to see
- [x] Get more statistics to do
- [ ] Make plotly graphs look better
- [ ] Add more functionality to main page such as another useful feature or an about page
- [x] Make entire website look better (html/css changes)

## Stats
- [x] Undergraduate count by program & faculty. Sorted by genders. From ST04.
- [x] Age distribution (not doing by part/full time SFU student because seems excessive to me). From ST20.
- [ ] Units enrolled distribution by season. From ST32.
- [ ] New undergraduates by faculty, year level, and gender. Also, going to extrapolate their growth by year. From ST12.
- [ ] Outcomes by concentration (probably only doing most popular programs since so many). From Baccalaureate Reports.
